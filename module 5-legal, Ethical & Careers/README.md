## ‚öñ Legal and Ethical Issues in Cybersecurity

Cybersecurity professionals often have access to sensitive systems and data. This makes it essential to act legally and ethically at all times.

###  Key Concepts Covered:
- *Legal Boundaries*: Skills must be used legally, even if you have the ability to hack.
- *Personal Ethics*: ‚ÄúJust because you can doesn‚Äôt mean you should.‚Äù
- *Corporate Responsibility*: Follow organizational policies and legal guidelines.
- *Case Study Insight*: When a colleague was found responsible for a breach, hiding the result might have seemed harmless, but the ethical choice was to report it.

###  Ethics Checklist Questions:
Ask yourself:
- Is it legal?
- Does it comply with company policy?
- Is it fair to stakeholders?
- Would I be okay if everyone acted this way?
- Would it look good on the front page of a newspaper?

*Bottom line: *What‚Äôs legal isn‚Äôt always ethical. Ethics requires transparency and responsibility.
