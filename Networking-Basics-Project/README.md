# Networking Basics Project

Welcome to my *Networking Fundamentals Project* â€“ designed to demonstrate hands-on understanding of basic network components, topologies, IP addressing, and diagnostic tools. This project serves as both a learning exercise and a showcase of my foundational networking skills.

This project was built step-by-step by running real network commands on my PC, analyzing the outputs, and documenting the screenshots and explanations in detail. It is structured in a way that any beginner can follow and learn how networking tools work in real-life scenarios.

---

##  Objective

To demonstrate how devices such as *routers, switches, hubs, and PCs* communicate on a basic network. Includes the use of diagrams, IP addressing, and command-line testing tools.

---

##  Course Source

This project was completed as part of the *Cisco Networking Basics Course*. All exercises and screenshots were done on my local machine to reinforce learning through hands-on practice.

##  Network Devices Diagram

![Network Diagram](./screenshots/network-devices-diagram.png)

This diagram illustrates the flow of data through common networking devices:

- *Router* â€“ Connects your network to the internet.
- *Switch* â€“ Sends data directly to the destination device (efficient).
- *Hub* â€“ Broadcasts data to all devices (older, less efficient).
- *PCs* â€“ Devices connected to the network.

##  Commands and Utilities Used

 whoami  
 hostname  
 systeminfo  
 ipconfig /all  
 Get-NetIPConfiguration  
 arp -a  
 netstat -an  
 nslookup  
 ping  
 tracert

Each command was tested and screenshots were taken as proof of output.

## ðŸ”¹ 6. arp -a

###  Purpose:
Displays the *ARP table* â€” showing IP-to-MAC address mapping on LAN.

###  What I Did:
bash
arp -a


###  What It Showed:
- Dynamic/static entries  
- IP â†” MAC address associations

## ðŸ”¹ 7. netstat -an

###  Purpose:
Displays *active connections*, ports, and states.

###  What I Did:
bash
netstat -an


###  What It Showed:
- Listening and established TCP/UDP ports  
- Remote IPs and states like ESTABLISHED, LISTENING

![netstat-an](./screenshots/netstat-an.png)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 8. nslookup google.com

###  Purpose:
Resolves a *domain name to an IP* using DNS.

###  What I Did:
bash
nslookup google.com


###  What It Showed:
- IP address of google.com  
- DNS resolver used

![nslookup](./screenshots/nslookup.png)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 9. ping google.com

###  Purpose:
Tests network reachability and *packet loss* between my computer and Google's server.

### What I Did:
bash
ping google.com


###  What It Showed:
- Round trip times  
- Packet loss  
- Confirmation that the network is working

![ping](./screenshots/ping.png)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 10. tracert google.com

### Purpose:
Traces the *route packets take* to reach Google servers.

###  What I Did:
bash
tracert google.com


###  What It Showed:
- Number of hops  
- IP addresses and response time of each router on the path

![tracert](./screenshots/tracert.png)

---

##  What I Learned

- The purpose and behavior of essential networking commands
- How to read and interpret IP addresses, MAC addresses, and DNS information
- How devices like routers, hubs, and switches operate differently
- How to trace the path of a packet and see where connections are being made
- Real-world testing of a PC's network behavior
